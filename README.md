# NITKART
NITKART is an online marketplace to "buy and sell" commodities in NITK Surathkal. It may be Electronic items,Household items, Books, Cycle, etc.

With this Android App, we can buy and sell goods or products online just by visiting the app. The seller has to post the advertisement by attaching description of the product(including the pics) and his/her details. The buyer can get the contact details(of the seller) if he/she is interested in buying the product. Hence both the parties have to mutually agree with the cost of the product and the time of the meeting (either to view or buy the product).

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly exchange that non-technical college students will feel comfortable placing entries and searching within for their new and used products.

## Installation

This requires Django for backend and AndroidStudio for frontend.

NITKART uses a quick and clean framework for requesting data from the server.<br>
